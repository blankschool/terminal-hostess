# Worker Stub

This is a minimal Hostinger worker stub to validate the Supabase flow.

## Run locally
```sh
cd worker
npm install
npm run start
```

## Next steps
Replace the stub logic in `worker/server.js` with:
- `yt-dlp` / `gallery-dlp` execution
- Upload to Supabase Storage
- Call `download-callback` with output items
